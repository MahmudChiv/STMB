      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions form the basis of your banking relationship
        with SwiftTrust Microfinance Bank Ltd (STMFB). They apply to all

        opening or using an account, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

        We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in law,
        regulation, or our services. The latest version will always be
        available on our website and mobile application.

        </li>
        <li>
          Where a facility becomes delinquent, you authorise us to report to the
          CBN via the Credit Risk Management System (CRMS) and acknowledge the

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VERIFYING YOUR IDENTITY (KYC)</h2>
      <p>
        Nigerian banking regulations require that we verify your identity
        before opening an Account. At a minimum, we’ll need an active mobile
        number, BVN and (where applicable) a profile photo and other supporting
        documents. Where permissible, you consent to us validating your details
        against relevant databases (e.g., NIN).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep your address, email and other contact information current
        to avoid service disruptions.
      </p>

      <h2>ACCOUNT TYPES & JOINT ACCOUNTS</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your chosen tier, you can fund via transfers, buy
        airtime, pay bills, make instant transfers, manage cards, and access
        savings/credit features where eligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        For joint accounts, we will obtain KYC from all parties. Unless the
        mandate states otherwise, each joint holder may operate the account,
        and all joint holders are jointly and severally responsible for any
        money owed.
      </p>

      <h2>NOTIFICATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        By opening an Account you consent to receive SMS, email and push
        notifications from SwiftTrust. These are for your use alone. We are not
        responsible for losses caused by someone else accessing your
        notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you opt out of CBN‑mandated SMS alerts in favour of push
        notifications, you agree to indemnify SwiftTrust from claims arising
        from that choice.
      </p>

      <h2>ELECTRONIC BANKING</h2>
      <p>
        Using our e‑banking channels (app, USSD, internet, ATM/POS and secure
        messaging), you can view balances, transfer funds, pay bills, place
        stop‑payments, and more. We will endeavour to act on valid
        instructions promptly, but some events are outside our control (e.g.,
        force majeure, network issues, system failures).
      </p>

      <h3>YOUR ACCESS CODES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Never disclose your PIN/password/OTP or write them down.</li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for instructions issued via your Access Codes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notify us immediately if you suspect compromise so we can help you
          reset them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CARDS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your card secure. Do not share your PIN, CVV or CVC.</li>
        <li>
          Cards are for lawful transactions in Nigeria and remain the property
          of SwiftTrust.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may renew, revoke or request the return of a card at our
          discretion.
        </li>
        <li>Cash withdrawals are limited to limits we publish from time to time.</li>
        <li>
          Transactions performed with your card/credentials are treated as
          authorised by you, including on joint accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report loss/theft promptly; you remain liable for unauthorised use up
          to two (2) Business Days after we receive your written report.
        </li>
        <li>Fees/commissions may apply and will be debited from your Account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ALERTS & STATEMENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep your device secure. Alerts are informational and presumed
          authorised.
        </li>
        <li>
          We aren’t liable for delayed/missed alerts arising from mobile
          network issues, maintenance or factors beyond our control.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may charge for alerts/statements; fees will be debited from your
          Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generate statements via the app; paper or durable‑medium statements
          are available on request (a fee may apply).
        </li>
        <li>
          Review your statement and report discrepancies promptly (no later than
          12 months from the disputed transaction).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>OVERDRAFTS & OTHER LOANS</h2>
      <p>
        Borrowing terms (interest, fees, security) will be communicated in
        writing. Unless we agree otherwise, overdrafts are repayable on demand.
        We may cancel standing orders/direct debits if your Account is
        overdrawn. You are responsible for our reasonable costs related to your
        borrowing.
      </p>

      <h2>WEB TRANSACTIONS INDEMNITY</h2>
      <p>
        If you ask us to enable your card for websites that do not require
        second‑level authentication (e.g., PIN/OTP), you agree to bear the
        risks (card detail exposure, cloning, unauthorised use) and indemnify
        SwiftTrust for losses arising from such transactions. We may debit your
        Account for amounts paid under this indemnity.
      </p>

      <h2>EMAIL INSTRUCTIONS INDEMNITY</h2>
      <p>
        If you instruct us to act on email instructions, you acknowledge the
        practical limits of verifying authenticity of every email. You agree
        that instructions appearing to come from you may be treated as your
        mandate, and you release and indemnify SwiftTrust from claims arising
        from acting on such instructions (including where later found to
        contain forgeries or alterations). We may decline to act on any email
        instruction at our discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, SwiftTrust may run referral programs where customers
        can earn cash rewards when Invitees sign up or when Referees complete
        specified actions. Full details—including the program period,
        qualifying events, maximum referrals and reward timing—will be shown
        in‑app or communicated by email.
      </p>
      <ul>

          You must comply with the program terms and your account must remain
          active (not restricted/suspended/closed) to receive rewards.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may reverse rewards if you breach program terms or abuse the
          program, and may close your account in cases of fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rewards may be taxable; you are responsible for any taxes due.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data processed during the program will align with our Privacy
          Policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>USER ACCOUNT & SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        To use our digital channels, create a user profile with your contact
        details and login credentials. Keep your password safe and do not allow
        others to use your profile. You are responsible for all activities
        under your User Account.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may suspend or terminate access at our discretion where we suspect
          inaccurate information, misuse or breach of these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unique identifiers we allocate remain our property and may be
          reclaimed upon deactivation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report suspected unauthorised access immediately at
          frauddesk@swifttrustmfb.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may suspend, withdraw or restrict services for operational reasons.
          We’ll try to give reasonable notice.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may close your Account at any time at no charge by giving us 30
          days’ notice and settling all outstanding sums.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your right to close is subject to any legal/regulatory holds or
          undertakings that prevent closure.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may close, suspend or limit your Account with 7 days’ notice where
          permitted by law (e.g., regulatory non‑compliance, risk, suspected
          fraud, legal requirement, breach of these Terms).
        </li>
        <li>
          After closure, remaining funds (less applicable taxes/fees) will be
          returned via manager’s cheque for pick‑up at the domiciled branch or
          transferred to a nominated account.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may discontinue products and either close the Account on 30 days’
          notice or migrate you to a suitable alternative.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>DORMANT ACCOUNTS</h2>
      <p>
        An account with no customer‑initiated activity for six (6) months may
        be treated as dormant. We may request fresh KYC to re‑activate it, or
        close the account and hold the funds in suspense pending your
        instructions.
      </p>

      <h2>HANDLING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        We collect and use your data in line with our Privacy Policy. We may
        retain information as permitted by law for legal, regulatory,
        fraud‑prevention and legitimate business purposes—even after
        relationship termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you provide information about others (e.g., joint holders or
        dependants), you confirm you have authority to do so. We may share
        information with agents who are contractually obliged to keep it
        confidential. We comply with applicable data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
      <p>
        SwiftTrust will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special or
        consequential losses arising from use or inability to use our products
        or services, or from failures outside our control (e.g., network
        outages, system errors, viruses, delays).
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding anything else, our aggregate liability for direct loss
        will not exceed the transaction fees that accrued to SwiftTrust from
        you in the one (1) month prior to the date your claim arose. These
        limitations survive termination.
      </p>

      <h2>BANKER’S LIEN & SET‑OFF</h2>
      <p>
        We may combine or consolidate your accounts and set‑off sums standing
        to your credit against your liabilities to us, whether contingent,
        primary, collateral, several or joint. Where you default on a credit
        facility, you acknowledge the CBN’s power to direct set‑off via CRMS
        from your funds held across financial institutions.
      </p>

      <h2>CLAIMS, DISPUTES & LEGAL PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        On receipt of a court order or notice of legal process affecting your
        Account (including joint accounts), we may restrict withdrawals or
        transfers until resolution. You agree to indemnify us against losses,
        costs and expenses arising from disputes between you and third parties
        involving your Account.
      </p>

      <h2>PROHIBITED USE & CRYPTOCURRENCY</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to use your Account for unlawful purposes, including
        money laundering or terrorist financing. In line with applicable
        regulations, SwiftTrust does not deal in or facilitate cryptocurrency
        or virtual asset transactions. We may restrict your Account and report
        to relevant agencies (e.g., EFCC, NFIU, NPF, NIBSS, CBN) if we detect
        fraudulent, suspicious, or crypto‑related activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also comply with international sanctions (OFAC, EU, UN, HMT). We may
        terminate the relationship if you or your Account is involved with
        sanctioned persons/entities or jurisdictions.
      </p>

      <h2>FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
      <p>
        We are not in breach for delays or failures caused by events beyond our
        reasonable control. Time for performance will be extended accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>GOVERNING LAW & DISPUTES</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of
        Nigeria. Disputes will be referred to Nigerian courts after a 10‑day
        amicable settlement window.
      </p>

      <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may change these Terms (including fees and interest). Where
          required, we will give notice via our website/app or by email/SMS.
